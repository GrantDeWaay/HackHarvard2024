# Harvard Burger üçî

Harvard Burger is a fun, voice-powered food ordering system that simulates a drive-through experience with an entertaining twist! Instead of a regular order-taker, you'll interact with an AI that has a quirky, funny personality. It uses voice detection and AI to transcribe, process, and fulfill orders, making the whole experience engaging and dynamic.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the Smart Cities track and wanted to build something with direct utility‚Äîlike ordering food‚Äîwhile keeping the interaction fun and playful. With Harvard Burger, we set out to bring a more engaging experience to the traditional drive-through by adding a humorous AI.

## What It Does

-   Detects when you start and stop speaking.
-   Uses AI to transcribe your voice input.
-   Figures out what food items you want to order, including specific details like size and flavor.
-   Generates audio responses with text-to-speech to confirm your order in an amusing way.

## How We Built It

-   **Frontend:** Built with React and TypeScript for handling the user interface.
-   **Backend:** Powered by Flask and Python, managing the AI logic and order processing.
-   **Deployment:** Containerized with Docker, deployed using Defang for cloud hosting.

## Challenges We Ran Into

-   Integrating the frontend, backend, and AI systems to communicate smoothly.
-   Ensuring seamless communication between different parts of the app after deployment.
-   Fine-tuning the AI‚Äôs ability to accurately process order details while maintaining a fun, natural conversation.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

-   We successfully implemented all the key features we envisioned.
-   We created a fully functional, deployed version of the app.
-   Overcame technical hurdles in both communication between app components and cloud deployment.

## What We Learned

-   We refined our skills in React, TypeScript, Flask, and Python, especially in how they interact.
-   Learned how to containerize and deploy apps using Docker and Docker Compose.
-   Gained experience deploying to the cloud with Defang.

## What's Next for Harvard Burger

We plan to expand the app by adding a business-facing interface, allowing restaurants to view and fulfill customer orders directly. This will turn _Harvard Burger_ into a practical tool for restaurants, beyond just a fun hackathon project.
